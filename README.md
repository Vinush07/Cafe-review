Coffee Shop Sentiment Analysis and Rating Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis and rating prediction for coffee shop reviews. The goal is to extract sentiments from reviews and predict overall sentiment labels using a combination of traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

Key Components
Data Loading and Exploration:

Utilized pandas for loading and exploring the dataset.
Calculated the mean of the 'rating' column for overall sentiment insights.
Sentiment Analysis:

Employed two different sentiment analysis approaches:
transformers library with a pre-trained RoBERTa model.
nltk library's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer.
Introduced a new 'sentiment' column based on the obtained sentiment scores.
Machine Learning Model (LSTM):

Utilized a Tokenizer to preprocess text data and pad sequences before training an LSTM-based neural network.
Applied binary classification with 'binary_crossentropy' loss and 'sigmoid' activation for sentiment prediction.
Model Evaluation and Prediction:

Trained and evaluated the LSTM model on a split dataset.
Implemented sentiment prediction for a sample comment and provided the predicted sentiment label.
Next Steps
Fine-tune model hyperparameters for better performance.
Explore ensemble techniques or transfer learning for improved sentiment analysis.
Address any potential class imbalance issues in sentiment labels.
Enhance documentation for better understanding and reproducibility.
